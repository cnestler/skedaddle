				<p class="desc">As city populations swell and refined ride-share (e.g., car and bike) programs gain traction, bus options -- although cheap -- are inefficient. People still have trouble getting to and from their favorite weekend outing destinations in a timely, affordable manner. Whether hiking, skiing, venturing to the beach, or going to a music festival, direct mass transit is an obstacle for many. <span class="skedaddle">Skedaddle</span> solves this problem by matching supply to demand. As demand for a destination grows, we create an appropriate route and seat capacity to accommodate a given number of passengers. As a web-based, crowdsourced platform for bus rentals, <span class="skedaddle">Skedaddle</span> simplifies group travel by offering direct routes at lower costs.</p><br />
